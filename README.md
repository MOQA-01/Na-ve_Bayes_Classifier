# Naïve Bayes classifier

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file titled `Naïve_Bayes_classifier.ipynb`, which demonstrates the implementation of a Naïve Bayes classifier. Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks, particularly in text processing, spam detection, and sentiment analysis.

## Requirements
To use this file, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python** (version 3.6 or later)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or an IDE that supports `.ipynb` files (e.g., VS Code with the Jupyter extension)
- Necessary Python libraries, which may include (but are not limited to):
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## File Content
The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**
   - Brief overview of the Naïve Bayes algorithm and its applications.

2. **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Steps to load the dataset (if applicable) and preprocess it for the Naïve Bayes classifier.

3. **Model Implementation**
   - Explanation of how the Naïve Bayes classifier is implemented using scikit-learn or other libraries.
   - Training the classifier on the dataset.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated and visualized.

5. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of results and potential improvements.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `Naïve_Bayes_classifier.ipynb` file.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Naïve_Bayes_classifier.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the cells sequentially by selecting a cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`.
5. Modify the code or dataset as needed to suit your use case.

## Customization
- Replace the dataset with your own by modifying the data loading and preprocessing sections.
- Adjust hyperparameters and model settings to optimize the classifier for your specific data.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and cleaned before running the notebook.
- If you encounter any issues or errors, verify that all required libraries are installed and compatible with your Python version.
